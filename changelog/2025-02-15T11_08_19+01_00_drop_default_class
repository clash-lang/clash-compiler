CHANGED: The Clash Prelude now exports the `Default` class from the package `data-default` instead of from the now superseded `data-default-class`. If you import the `Default` class name or the `def` function from the `data-default-class` package _older than version 0.2_, or one of your dependencies does, you might get a bewildering error message. You might get the error "No instance for (Default T)" even though there appears to be such an instance. The best solution is to make sure all your packages and dependencies use the `data-default` package and not the `data-default-class` package. The next most obvious solution is to make sure `data-default-class` is of version 0.2 or higher, for instance by depending on it in your own package. If this creates a dependency conflict, another solution is to import the correct module. `Default` and `def` from `Clash.Prelude` or `Data.Default` are for the new `data-default` package. `Data.Default.Class` is for the `data-default-class` package. There are situations where this will still not be enough, but luckily the `Default` class is not used all that much.
