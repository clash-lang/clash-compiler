ADDED: Alongside the existing Eq-like and Ord-like signal operators like `.==.` and `.<=.` etc., there are now new functions for comparing with constants: `.==`, `==.`, `./=`, `/=.`, `.<=`, `<=.`, `.>=`, `>=.`, `.>`, `>.`, `.<`, `<.`, `.&&`, `&&.`, `.||`, `||.`. These are useful for comparing signals with constants in a more readable way. For example, `a .==. pure True` can now be replaced with `a .== True`.
