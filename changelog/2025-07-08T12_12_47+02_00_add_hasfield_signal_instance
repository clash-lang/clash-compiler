ADDED: instance `HasField f (Signal dom r) (Signal dom a)`. This means record dot accesses will be passed to the underlying type. For example, this will work:

```haskell
data MyRecord = MyRecord { myField :: Int }

a :: Signal dom MyRecord
a = pure (MyRecord 3)

b :: Signal dom Int
b = a.myField
```
