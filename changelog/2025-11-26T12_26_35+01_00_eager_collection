FIXED: In Clash simulation, `pack` for `Vec` and `RTree` had all bits undefined when the spine of the value had an `XException`. Now, those elements with defined bits will output those defined bits. In HDL, this was already the case. Example: consider `xs = 1 :> undefined :> Nil :: Vec 2 (Unsigned 4)` and `ys = 1 :> undefined :: Vec 2 (Unsigned 4). `xs` merely has an undefined element, but `ys` has an undefined spine: it is a `:>` constructor that is undefined. `pack ys` used to be `0b...._....` but is now `0b0001_....`, just as `pack xs` already was.
