Normal forms for the partial evaluator. These provide a restricted model of
how terms can be constructed (compared to the more liberal Term type) which
give a stronger guarantee that evaluation does not produce invalid results.
This module is only needed to define new evaluators, for calling an existing
evaluator see Clash.Core.PartialEval.

-- | Neutral terms cannot be reduced, as they represent things like variables
-- which are unknown, partially applied functions, or case expressions where
-- the subject cannot be inspected. Consider:
--
-- v              Stuck if "v" is a free variable
-- p x1 ... xn    Stuck if "p" is a primitive that cannot be reduced
-- x $ y          Stuck if "x" is not known to be a lambda
-- x @ A          Stuck if "x" is not known to be a type lambda
-- case x of ...  Stuck if "x" is neutral (cannot choose an alternative)
--
-- Neutral terms can also be let expressions which preserve required bindings
-- in the normal form representation. Examples of bindings that may be kept are
-- bindings which perform work (and should not be copied) or bindings that
-- are recursive and are still referred to by the body of the let expression.

-- let ... in ... Preserved bindings are needed by the body
