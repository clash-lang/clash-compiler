version: '1.6.3'
summary: 'Clash: from Haskell to hardware'
description: |
  Clash is a functional hardware description language that borrows both its
  syntax and semantics from the functional programming language Haskell. The
  Clash compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to low-level
  synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.
